## svelte app

This is a Svelte app for recording points in a baseball game. Set up by a Dad who understands svelte better than baseball scoring.
It is a Work in progress. More information on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/dr-jerry/baseballscore. And it is [alive here]http://www.dijkmeijer.com/basescore/.
Also beware that I'm Dutch and I have no baseball experience.

## Current funtions
- bench lists all players (hard coded)
- first bench player can be dragged on to home.
